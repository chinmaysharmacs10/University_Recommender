# MS in US University Recommender
* Created a deep learning model that recommends a University a student should apply to based on the academic details entered. A web application was made to take in the details of
the student and get a recommendation from the model by passing the details as input.
* The model is a multi-class classifier that provies the class (which is the University) based on the details of the applicant.
* The data was cleaned of missing values and more preprocessing was done to obtain the cleaned dataset. 
* Exploratory data analysis on the cleaned data to get insights about the data and its distribution.
* A __deep neural network__ was built using __Keras__ for multi-class classifiaction.
* Built a client facing web application using __Django__. 
* __Python Version__: 3.6.10
* __Libraries Used__: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn, imblearn, Tensorflow, Keras, Django
